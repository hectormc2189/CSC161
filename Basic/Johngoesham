John was a curious young fella.
He liked his ham, maybe a bit too much. Ham was his hobby, his passion, his ultimate pleasure.
However, the pigs who provided this ham were not to be trusted.
Then were vunerable to disease, and one certain pig contracted Covid! :o
Unbenownst to John, the particular piece of ham he planned to devour came from this unholy pig. 
What happened next is history...

Stay tuned to John and his glorious tales of ham!
